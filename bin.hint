ldesc: "GNU Aspell is a Free and Open Source spell checker designed to
eventually replace Ispell. It can either be used as a library or as an
independent spell checker. Its main feature is that it does a superior
job of suggesting possible replacements for a misspelled word than just
about any other spell checker out there for the English language. Unlike
Ispell, Aspell can also easily check documents in UTF-8 without having
to use a special dictionary. Aspell will also do its best to respect the
current locale setting. Other advantages over Ispell include support for
using multiple dictionaries at once and intelligently handling personal
dictionaries when more than one Aspell process is open at once."
